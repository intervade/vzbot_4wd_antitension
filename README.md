# My printer, my tensioner!

I love the simplicity and speed that VzBot printers offer. However, I'm not a fan of the motor mount tensioners, whether it be the 2wd or 4wd options. Since I'm going to be running a 4wd set up, I looked at those repos. I did not like how the tensioner stuck through the front, making what could be two door pieces into four. Removing the tensioners from the motor mounts means that the tensioners from the EVA carriages have to be used. I'm not looking to shave every gram from my toolhead, so I don't really mind.

## What's uploaded?
I modified the plastic version of the 4wd motor mounts to be usable from a point not at the top of the printer. Additionally, the front motor mounts have a matching hole to be clamped onto the sides of the front extrusions. Only the left versions were modified, so mirror them in your slicer. I also reversed the direction of the teeth in the EVA tensioners.
